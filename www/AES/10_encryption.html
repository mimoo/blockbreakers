<p>We're almost done! Now is time to combine all the functions we've created into a single <code>encrypt()</code> function</p>

<p>The first phase is called "<strong>pre-whitening</strong>". And is to âŠ• (XOR) your state (which right now is your plaintext) with the first round key (which is the original key provided to AES).</p>

<p>This <strong>pre-whitening</strong> is done to avoid losing the first few transformations to the attacker. If no XOR with a round key was in place, the attacker could compute the internal state of AES up to the <strong>AddRoundKey</strong> operation of the first round (and ignore the first few transformations).</p>

<p>After this, exactly n-1 rounds take place. In the case of AES-128 this would be <strong>9 rounds</strong>. Each round will take the subsequent round key. (Starting with the second round key, since we already used the first in the pre-whitening phase.) Here is what a round looks like:</p>

<p>Finally, <strong>a last round takes place</strong>, but this time the MixColummns transformation is skipped. And if you counted correctly, the final and 11th key is used in the AddRoundKey transformation.</p>

<p>And that's it! That's all there is to AES' encryption.</p>

<p>Implement the <code>encrypt()</code> function. Then encrypt this text: <code>theblockbreakers</code> with the following key:</p>

<pre>2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c</pre>

<p>and verify that you get the following ciphertext:</p>

<pre>
c6 02 23 2f
9f 5a 93 05
25 9e f6 b7
d0 f3 3e 47
</pre>	

<p><strong>Remember</strong>: to test your function, you can use the test vectors from the appendix A.1 of the <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips197/fips-197.pdf">AES standard</a>. We also gave some other good resources to understand and test your implementation <a href="aes.html">in the main page of this set</a>.</p>
