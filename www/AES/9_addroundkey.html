<p>The last transformation of a round is called <strong>AddRoundKey</strong>, and at this point you probably have an idea of what it is. And you're also probably right, it is just a XOR between the values in the state, and the values of your round key.</p>

<p>Once you are done with the <code>AddRoundKey()</code> function, make sure that all of the round functions you have implemented until now, properly work together. You can use the diagram in this page to do that.</p>
