<p>Now that we've broken <span class="em">4-round AES</span>, let's try and see what we can do if we add an extra round at the end to make it a <span class="em">5-round AES</span>.</p>

<img class="ui centered image" src="images/SQUARE/SQUARE-11.jpg">

<p>You could guess 4 bytes of the last <em>round key</em> to reverse the state until the end of the 4th round (second to last round). Right after XORing it with the penultimate <em>round key</em>. Here you could also guess 4 bytes of that last <em>round key</em> to continue the relevant bytes and end up by performing the same attack as the previous one. In total we have to guess 8 bytes of subkeys to start the attack, that's already a lot.</p>

<p>What if we could swap the penultimate round's MixColumn operation with the AddRoundKey operation? That would allow us to only guess one byte of the penultimate <em>round key</em>.</p>

<p>Well guess what. We can. Sort of.</p>

<p>How to do?</p>

<p>The MixColumns is linear with respect to the column input. This is a fancy way to mean:</p>

\[
\begin{align*}
&\text{MixColumns}(\text{state)} \oplus \text{RoundKey} \\
= &\text{MixColumns}(\text{state}) \oplus \text{MixColumns}(\text{MixColumnsInv}(\text{RoundKey})) \\
= &\text{MixColumns}(\text{state } \oplus \text{MixColumnsInv}(\text{RoundKey}))
\end{align*}
\]

<ol>
	<li>The first line represented our state after the penultimate MixColumns followed by the AddRoundKey transformation.</li>
	<li>The last line represent the state we wanted to achieve: the AddRoundKey transformation now happens after the MixColumns operation. It's enough to allow us to do our attack without having to guess 4 bytes of the penultimate <em>round key</em>, but instead only a single byte of the penultimate <code>MixColumnsInv(RoundKey)</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>In total, with the four bytes of the last <em>round key</em>, we now have to guess 5 bytes to recover one byte of the last <em>round key</em>. Here's how the final attack now looks like:</p>

<p>This attack is taking too much computing power already. To cover 5 bytes of key you need to test \(2^{8*5} = 2^{40}\) possibilities tops. This is not impossible, just not fun as an unoptimized code and an OK machine will take too long to finish the attack.</p>

<p>Instead we will satisfy ourselves with these explanations, and maybe even try to understand how to extend this attack to <span class="em">6-round AES</span> in the next section.</p>
