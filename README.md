# Cryptapals

## Todo

* Find a better name
* Set on Linear Cryptanalysis
* Set on Differential Cryptanalysis
* What other attacks?

## Intro

This page is here to teach you block **cipher cryptanalysis**. It does not pretend to be an exhaustive list of attacks, but will give you enough to get started.
The course is split in several sets, the first being on *AES*. We could have made up a simple block cipher, but it's more fun to attack the real thing don't you think so?
So head up to [Set 1](/AES/) and implement AES. Don't worry, we're holding your hand ;)
